### ⚙️ Guiding Principles

1. **Have** clear goals.
2. **Identify and don’t tolerate** the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals.
   - View painful problems as potential improvements that are screaming at you.
   - Don’t avoid confronting problems because they are rooted in harsh realities that are unpleasant to lookat.
   - Once you identify a problem, don’t tolerate it.
3. **Accurately diagnose** the problems to get at their root causes.
4. **Design** plans that will get you around them.
5. **Do what’s necessary** to push these designs through to results.
   - You need to push through and that requires self-discipline to follow your script.
   - Good workhabits are vastly underrated.
   - Establish clear metrics to make certain that you are following your plan.

Blurring the steps leads to suboptimal outcomes. The process is iterative.
