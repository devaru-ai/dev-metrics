- Significantly weak at networking
- Got to the root causes, restructured it
- Expanded the team, got guidance of an extremely talented professional who's great at networking.
- I was able to reuse the templates, and many methods, rather than developing from scratch, enabled me to get faster improvement, so I could ensure visiblity for research without compromising on time trade off.
