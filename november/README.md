# Week 1 and 2
- Goals were to improve visibility
- Gained traction reached over 16k impressions on linkedin
- A viral post that gained approx. 100 new followers

# Week 3 and 4
- Decided to iterate and shoot higher 
- Gained visibility in various Meta Labs
- Simplified DSA to pattern based prep

# Big Failures I wanna Fix in December
- Focussed Interview Prep and less generalized work in terms of visibility
- Allocate time for specific emails and connections rather than casting a wide net
- Build genuine connections and turn it into referrals
- Nov helped me gain confidence on validating the work and more hopeful on referrals. I largely underestimated how I'd be perceived on the market.
