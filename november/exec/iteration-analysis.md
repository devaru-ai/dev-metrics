# Iteration 2 Analysis 


## Goal - Update Faulty and Invalid Hypotheses
| Hypothesis | Real World Results | What Caused the Delta | Impact on Iteration 3 |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Largely underestimated the impact: Thought it would be picked by 10 or 15, max 20 people, wildest 36 | It reached over 10k people, over 15k impressions, over 100 followers, and most of them were senior engineers from top companies | **Add value. Build systems. Do your Analysis. Contribute your work. Move the needle. It changes the whole game.** That's what gets attention from senior leaders. | The plane changes when you're a top performer. Certain things get way easier than the normal crowd. The goals should change. From just getting a chance at referral/interview --> Actually performing well at interviews and building technology. |


- Rather than restating a technology, show what you can build with it. When you do that, it separates you from the 99% crowd. And you can easily become the top 1%. 
- By easy, I mean after tremendous hard work, and making sure your presentation is top notch, clear and concise.

# What caused the Results
My hypotheses were largely based on what I observed as results from conventional systems. Even though, my strategy differed I wrongly extrapolated the results from a conventional system plus an incremental improvement.

| Conventional System | My System | Real World Results |
|---------------------|-----------|--------------------|
|  Bottom Up: Build incremental systems. Taking ideas from immediate network and implement.  |   Top Down: Listen from great engineers at top companies on what's important and use your brain to build systems out of it.        |  You get used to building skills at exponential rate.                  |
| Thinks every technical work is more or less equally valuable. |  Estimates value of work before starting.        |  You get visibility quickly. At exponential rate.                  |
| Randomly or with less rigor, chooses what to work on.   |  Rigorous vetting and chooses only highly valuable work. But will build small projects to build skills as a bridge to a high impact work.       | Skills Build. Impact multiplies exponentially.                   |
| Aims same level or slightly higher.                   |Aims crazy high. Well aware of the risk. Almost always chooses things that have 1% chances of working out, but if it does it brings exponential growth. Builds systems, Gets creative to derisk. Eventually brings down risk, yet it's scary situation, and lots of uncertainity.           | Well, its fun.                   |
| Less Pivoting | Always pivots, dynamically updates with new data | Great Results. Almost always makes impossible things possible.|

# Uncomfortable Growth

- Take Risks. 
- Execution eats Strategy for Breakfast.
- Execute. Execute. Execute.
- When things get hard, it's an opportunity to be more creative and even more brilliant.
- Be Humble. Listen. But, Have Conviction.
- Most importantly, Check if your beliefs are true. Wrong hypotheses like these lead to lost opportunities, and lost productivity. Unfortunately, Einstein didn't discover how to reverse time.

# Updates for Iteration 3

- Be more confident and expect better results.
- Double down on high value research and projects.
- Increase visibility.
- Don't worry about whether you'll get an opportunity. Worry about how to seize the opportunity.
- Build great technology. Reach out to people. Sometimes, it's that simple. The world unnecessarily complicates things.
- Do not try to do things alone, get help if needed, learn from others, but use your brain.
- Keep it simple.
- Happy Coding!
