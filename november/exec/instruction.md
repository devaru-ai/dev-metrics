## Iteration 1


| Instruction                 | Category     | Difficulty Level | Time Taken | Bottleneck | Reason for Bottleneck |
|------------------------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 11 Tree Coding Problems      | Repetitive   | Easy             |     2 + est. 3        | Discipline to Follow Through, Taking too much time (Goal: Finish in 45 mins + 1 hr) | Estimated time was unreasonable. To study thoroughly, understanding 10 problems took approx 2 hrs, Coding variations est. 3 hrs. Discipline was not an issue.               |
|Implement a PyTorch training loop from scratch                              | Repetitive             |        Easy          |   4 hrs          |  Don't see any.           |     Due to expertise in ML Algos and Training experiments.                  |
|Implement L1, L2 reg in PyTorch and Tensorflow. Implement custom Adam optimizer algo.|       Repetitive       |           Easy       |    2 + 3 hrs      |     Nothing really.           |                  Straightforward. Brush up on concepts and implement problems. Learn from questions.    |
|   Implement algo on sparse attention research                           |    Known and New          |      Difficult and great for learning.            |             |   Too much fun.          | Have difficulty making it healthy. Taking breaks is difficult to follow.                     |

### Definition
| Category | Definition |
|-----------|-------------|
| New uncharted territory | Tasks that involve unfamiliar concepts, requiring exploration and experimentation. |
| Repetitive but difficult | Tasks that occur frequently yet still demand significant focus, skill, or problem-solving. |
| Repetitive but easy | Tasks that are routine, predictable, and can be completed with minimal cognitive effort. |
