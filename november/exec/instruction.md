# Instruction
## Iteration 1


| Instruction                 | Category     | Difficulty Level | Time Taken | Bottleneck | Reason for Bottleneck |
|------------------------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 11 Tree Coding Problems      | Repetitive   | Easy             |     2 + est. 3        | Discipline to Follow Through, Taking too much time (Goal: Finish in 45 mins + 1 hr) | Estimated time was unreasonable. To study thoroughly, understanding 10 problems took approx 2 hrs, Coding variations est. 3 hrs. Discipline was not an issue.               |
|Implement a PyTorch training loop from scratch                              | Repetitive             |        Easy          |   4 hrs          |  Don't see any.           |     Due to expertise in ML Algos and Training experiments.                  |
|Implement L1, L2 reg in PyTorch and Tensorflow. Implement custom Adam optimizer algo.|       Repetitive       |           Easy       |    2 + 3 hrs      |     Nothing really.           |                  Straightforward. Brush up on concepts and implement problems. Learn from questions.    |
|   Implement algo on sparse attention research                           |    Known and New          |      Difficult and great for learning.            |    Deferred to get max results. Visiblity of research is critical. Paralleling with better communications and research would give max rewards, esp cuz networking skills are significantly bad. It needs immediate attention.         |   Too much fun.          | Have difficulty making it healthy. Taking breaks is difficult to follow.                     |
|   Networking skills - Master it!                        |    Unknown and New          |      Anxiety inducing           |   6 days (Part) 4 days (FT)         |   Unchartered territory        | Too many bugs in system, needed fixing - anxiety, root causes of suboptimal communication, better mentors and peers to support growth.                     |

## Iteration 1 Results
- Fixed troubles in networking. From 10-20% -> 70% good.
- Key: Finding talented people that are already best at it, reusing 90% of their resources, and learning from their mindset and execution
- Taking my first principles thinking and solving my issues in networking and understanding why people fail and how people succeed
- Transfering research skills to improving networking skills from 70% good -> 90-95% good, implementing ideas from my analysis
- Add on: Borrowing interview prep templates from talented professionals rather than create from scratch -> saves time, quality methods, tested and proven.
- Key Learning: Don't try to grow alone, Get Help, when required. Being good at AI Research doesn't mean I cannot be a beginner at networking. (But it means, learning could be fast)

## Iteration 2 

| Instruction | Category | Difficulty Level | Time Taken | Bottleneck | Reason for Bottleneck |
|-------------|----------|------------------|------------|------------|----------------------|
| Execute Networking: Post the vLLM work            | New unchartered territory         |    Extremely High, High Risk, 99% chances of failure             |  4 days (post) + 3 days (analysis + iteration 3)          |     Highest chances of failure       |  Doing it first time, it was all strategizing until this point, so a lot of confidence was based on hypothesis, no guarantee the real world results would match my analysis.                    |

## Iteration 2 Results
-  Real world results exceeded my expectations, orders of magnitude difference in reach, huge positive response from the industry
-  Work validated by senior engineers from Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, Meta Chief Architects and Investors 
-  Key Learning: I largely underestimated my talent in strategising and building; ability to understand market, solve relevant problems and networking abilities.

### The goal of Iteration $$e^{3x}$$ is to largely increase the learning rate and see if I can pull it off
# Iteration $$e^{3x}$$

| Instruction | Category | Difficulty Level | Time Taken | Bottleneck | Reason for Bottleneck |
|-------------|----------|------------------|------------|------------|----------------------|
| Results on Llama 3.1 | Repetitive |  Slightly Difficult |  5 hrs          |            |                      |
| Trees  - 10, Graphs - 10  | Repetitive  |  Easy |  5 hrs        |            |                      |
|  Heaps - 8, Stacks - 8  | Repetitive  |  Easy  |   5 hrs         |            |                      |
| Emails to 5 teams, 5 people |  New uncharted territory|  Terrifying | 2 + 3 hrs |            |                      |
| Move the needle on job search, Apply more and connect more | New uncharted territory |  Exciting and Terrifying | 10 hrs           |            |                      |
| Find 5 people whose work genuinely excites you and connect with them | New uncharted territory |  All prepared and Exciting |            |            |                      |
| Explain your work the best, Always be ready to explain technical work to different stakeholders  | Repetitive, Improving  | Exciting to dive in to communication cuz it helps me understand concepts well and enables me to think about how it can be used |            |            |                      |


### Definition
| Category | Definition |
|-----------|-------------|
| New uncharted territory | Tasks that involve unfamiliar concepts, requiring exploration and experimentation. |
| Repetitive but difficult | Tasks that occur frequently yet still demand significant focus, skill, or problem-solving. |
| Repetitive but easy | Tasks that are routine, predictable, and can be completed with minimal cognitive effort. |
