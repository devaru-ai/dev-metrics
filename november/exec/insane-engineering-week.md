# A Week to Achieve Insane Goals

This is a fun crazy launch because I want some exponential growth in tasks and I don't have the patience to wait for several weeks. I want everything done superfast. So, I'm gonna make it happen.

- Master all DSA patterns - basic coding should be fun, and I don't think one should allocate more time for it. Why do it in 10 weeks when you can do it in 10 days? Doesn't make sense.
- Finish off sparse attention - just final lap left. closing it will help me gain momentum with visibility. It builds confidence to email some pretty good engineers.
- Zero in on some 3 teams at least or 30 whatever seems ideal in the process. We need some revenue coming in.

# Updates 
### Goal 1. Completed Master all DSA patterns!!!
- Came up with a new way of learning.
- Designed learning in 3 stages:
  
## 1. Pretraining: 
## Trick: Build a revision module for all DSA topics.
- 66.5 hrs over Fri, Sat, Sun and Monday Morning 
- Outcome: I'm comfortable with all DSA topics.
- Huge Degree improvement from Friday, when I started **10% -> 60%**
- Time: 3 days
## 2. Revising
- With revision module, I can cover one round of revision in a day across all topics.
- That should make me confident in over 150 problems. **Confidence score: 90%**
- Time: 3 days (3 rounds of revision)
## 3. Generalizing
  - Train on my own. This would be easy since all I have to do is match the patterns that I already have terrific experience in 5 problems on average per topic, revised 3-4 times = 20 times, I might've gone through the pattern before the entirely new set.
  - Time: From Day 7
 
# Next on List: Sparse attention!
