# A Week to Achieve Insane Goals

This is a fun crazy launch because I want some exponential growth in tasks and I don't have the patience to wait for several weeks. I want everything done superfast. So, I'm gonna make it happen.

- Master all DSA patterns - basic coding should be fun, and I don't think one should allocate more time for it. Why do it in 10 weeks when you can do it in 10 days? Doesn't make sense.
- Finish off sparse attention - just final lap left. closing it will help me gain momentum with visibility. It builds confidence to email some pretty good engineers.
- Zero in on some 3 teams at least or 30 whatever seems ideal in the process. We need some revenue coming in.
